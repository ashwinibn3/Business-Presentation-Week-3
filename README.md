# Business-Presentation-Week-3
This project was done as part of my Data Analyst internship. XYZ, a private investment firm, wanted to compare two cab companies — Yellow Cab and Pink Cab — to decide which one to invest in.

I explored the data, tested business hypotheses, and built a simple predictive model to support the recommendation.

Key Insights
Yellow Cab has 3× more rides and higher profit than Pink Cab

Profits peak on weekends and holidays

Cities like DC and Boston are most profitable per user

Gender distribution is similar, with Pink Cab having slightly more female users

Predictive model shows longer rides, high-income areas, and Yellow Cab = more profit

Recommendation
XYZ should invest in Yellow Cab due to its stronger performance, wider reach, and higher profitability.
